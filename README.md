# KAPR-CLI 💻🚀
KAPR-CLI is an on-premises web monitoring & testing tool, offering comprehensive testing capabilities through Selenium with Chrome. With KAPR-CLI, you can automate browser actions and test scenarios easily.

## Why KAPR?
KAPR was born out of frustration with Pingdom. Constant issues and unreliable support led to the creation of KAPR-CLI. By developing my own solution, I hope to provide a more dependable & customisaable alternative to Pingdom, ensuring that users can rely on their monitoring tools without constant interruptions and blame-shifting. This tool can also be used internally allowing critical but none exposed sites to be monitored.

## Installation
If you wish to use this project without compiling then please take the latest release, pingdom currently does *NOT* support automatic updates so you will need to obtain all new versions manually.

If you wish to compile this project yourself or want to make your own changes
